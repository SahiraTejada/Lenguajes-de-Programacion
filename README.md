## 8. Usuarios notables: 
- ### **Discord** ###  
Is a free voice and text chat for gamers. They used Elixir to scale up to 5,000,000 concurrency users and millions of events per second.

- ### **Findmypast** ###  
Makes original historical documents available to search online, so that people can explore a collection of over two billion records find their ancestors and trace their family tree from the comfort of their own home, worldwide.

- ### **Pinterest** ###  
Is using Elixir for its notification system to deliver 14,000 notifications per second. The notification system runs across 15 servers, whereas the old system, written in Java, ran on 30. The new code is about one-tenth of the size of the old code.

## 9. Historia: 
Creadores, 1er Release (versión y fecha), Ultimo release (versión y fecha)
José Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language, a research and development project created at Plataformatec. His goals were to enable higher extensibility and productivity in the Erlang VM while keeping compatibility with Erlang's ecosystem.[23][24]

José Valim aimed to create a programming language for large-scale sites and apps. Being a Ruby developer, he used features of Ruby, Erlang, and Clojure to develop a high-concurrency and low-latency language. Elixir was designed to handle large data volumes. Its speed and capabilities spread Elixir in telecommunication, eCommerce, and finance industries.[25]

Enter José Valim. Valim had a sincere appreciation for Erlang but wanted to make it easier to use. Taking inspiration from other languages like Ruby, Clojure, and Haskell, Valim combined the power and resilience of Erlang with a friendlier syntax that is more accessible to developers trained on Ruby, Python, and the like. Thus, in 2012, Elixir was born.

Like Erlang, Elixir can manage millions of simultaneous connections, which makes it perfect for communications. For example, the game chat application Discord has relied on Elixir to support five million users at a single time.[5] However, it would be short-sighted to see Elixir as a telecom language alone.
