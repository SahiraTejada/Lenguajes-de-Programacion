# Programming languages #
### ***Subject Assignment IDS347-1*** ###

## 1. Purpose
Elixir is a dynamic and functional language for creating scalable and maintainable applications.

---
## 2. Paradigm ##

Process-oriented programming

---
## 3. Strengths

- Velocity
- Reliability
- concurrence
-Productivity
- Fault tolerance
- Scalability
-clean syntax

---
## 4. Weaknesses

- Fewer Elixir programming jobs
- Lack of Elixir developers
- Elixir is a young programming language
-smaller community
-smaller ecosystem
- Knowledge of Erlang is required

---
## 5. Implementation
Elixir is a compiled language, but when you work with it it behaves like an interpreted language

---
## 6.Runtime
The Elixir runtime is an instance of BEAM. Once the build is done, the OS process is started and Erlang takes full control. Everything runs inside this process and has access to the code because the VM tracks all the modules in memory.

---
## 7. Supported Platforms

- MacOS/OSX
- Linux
- Microsoft Windows
- BSD
---
## 8. Notable users

- ### **Discord** ###
It is a free voice and text chat for gamers. They used Elixir to scale up to 5,000,000 concurrent users and millions of events per second.

- ### **Findmypast** ###
Makes original historical documents available to search online, so people can explore a collection of more than two billion records, find their ancestors, and trace their family tree from the comfort of their home, on everyone.

- ### **Pinterest** ###
It is using Elixir for its notification system to deliver 14,000 notifications per second. The notification system runs on 15 servers, while the old system, written in Java, ran on 30. The new code is about a tenth the size of the old code.

- ### **Adobe** ###
You are using Elixir to build a client/cloud application for collaborative photography workflows.

## 9. Story
Creators, 1st release (version and date), Latest release (version and date)
Jos√© Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language, a research and development project created at Platformec. His goals for him were to enable greater extensibility and productivity in the Erlang virtual machine while maintaining compatibility with the Erlang ecosystem. Elixir was designed to handle large volumes of data. Its speed and capabilities spread Elixir in the telecommunications, e-commerce and finance industries. Taking inspiration from other languages such as Ruby, Clojure, and Haskell, Valim combined the power and resiliency of Erlang with a friendlier syntax that is more accessible to developers trained in Ruby, Python, and the like. On Thursday, April 7 2022, Elixir was born. Like Erlang, Elixir can handle millions of simultaneous connections, making it perfect for communications. For example, gaming chat app Discord has relied on Elixir to support five million users at a time.

The latest stable version of Elixir June 4, 2022.
